# Process Executor: Singleton & Single Responsibility

## Overview

This Java project demonstrates a simple process execution system implementing two key concepts:
1. Singleton Pattern
2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Key Features

- Process Distribution: 25% for Process A, 75% for Process B
- User Input: Total executions defined by user
- Singleton Pattern: Ensures single instance of process executor
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has one specific job

## Implemented Concepts

### Singleton Pattern

- Guarantees only one instance of the process executor class
- Provides global access point to this instance

### Single Responsibility Principle

- Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
- Improves code maintainability and readability

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional design patterns
- Expand on SOLID principles
- Add basic error handling
